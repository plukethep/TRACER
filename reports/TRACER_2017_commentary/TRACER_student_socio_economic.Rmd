In this area at least, CS has become a more diverse subject than it was, perhaps through more providers choosing to offer the subject, although it still compares unfavourably with many other subjects. Pupil Premium students score rather lower grades (43.2% gain a C or above) than their more affluent counterparts (62.7%)
 
At A-level, a lower proportion of A-level CS students have been in receipt of Pupil Premium than in previous years. Again, Pupil Premium students score rather lower grades than their more affluent counterparts, with only 7 (1.5%)  pupil premium students gaining an A\* in 2017, compared to 188 (3%) of their more affluent peers.
