
42.9% of CS providers at GCSE have a cohort smaller than 20, this is slightly better than in 2015 (47.6%)
 
The larger the school (both in terms of pupils and GCSE offerings), the more likely it is to offer computer science - the picture for computer science provision by schools (although not yet take up by students) is now broadly comparable to that for GCSE physics.  
 
Cohort size for GCSE CS, where it is offered, seem to be sustainable in the majority of schools, although it is still well below that for ICT and Physics.
 
Whilst only 52.5% of providers offer GCSE CS, the schools that do are typically larger schools, and thus 76.3% of students are in schools where the subject is offered: in fact more students are in schools where CS is offered than physics (although the take up of the subject is substantially lower). There has been a rapid increase in this measure over the last four years.
 
86.5% of A-level CS groups have fewer than 12 students, which DfE guidance regards as being the level that is needed to make a course viable in a provider (11.7 students [@parish2017understanding]). The mean cohort size is 6.7 and the median just 5 students. With ongoing budgetary concerns in sixth form education, computer science is at risk of being financially unsustainable in the majority of providers.
 
As with GCSE, larger providers are more likely to offer CS than smaller ones, but the likelihood that any provider offers the subject is much less than for physics.
Whilst only 36% of providers offer CS at A-level, the reach of the subject (ie the proportion of students in centres where the subject is offered) is 57% - this has increased over the last four years, but it still remains substantially below Physics (96.6%)
