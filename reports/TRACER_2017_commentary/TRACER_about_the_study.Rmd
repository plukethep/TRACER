
The Roehampton Annual Computing Education Report (TRACER) was first published in 2016 to provide an overview of the student and school characteristics in relation to GCSE and A-level computing qualifications. In this May 2018 update, we continue our analyses of the Department of Education's National Pupil Database (NPD) linked to Edubase, with the focus on data from exams taken in the 2016/17 academic year, although we also draw on statistics from as far back as 2013/14 to explore recent patterns where relevant.  
 
The data is presented in three main sections: provider profile, student profile and qualifications overview. For each section, we are interested in the different ways in which participation and attainment in GCSE and A-level computer science might vary. Under the provider profile, we analyse the uptake of computer science by school governance (with a closer inspection on multi-academy trusts), types of school, gender composition of school, location of school (regions; local authority; rural/urban; coastal/inland), and provider/cohort size. Under the student profile, we explore the role of gender, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, Special education needs (SEN), English as an Additional Language (EAL), entry grade profile and subject combinations. Under the qualifications overview we look at the range of computing qualifications currently being taken by students in schools in England. In particular, comparisons are made with the subject ICT, where appropriate, given computer science is the de facto replacement [@Gibb2018ICT], and physics, another single science.
