

At GCSE, students with any Special Educational Needs (SEN) categorisation are less likely to have sat computer science than ICT. At A-level computer science students are substantially more likely to have a SEN categorisation than their peers taking ICT and physics; the reasons for this remain unclear.

Please note that SEN policy has changed since 2014, with students now being less likely to qualify for SEN categories. This may explain the overall decrease in the number of students classified as having SEN provision.
