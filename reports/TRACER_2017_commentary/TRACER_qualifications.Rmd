
This section looks to expand our understanding of computing education for KS4 (~16 year olds) and KS5 (~18 year olds) beyond GCSE and A-level. We will be looking at other qualifications that are categorised as being under the computing umbrella. This includes courses that involve digital media and electronics, as well as Entry level exams and a range of vocational courses, including Pearson BTECs and Cambridge Nationals. 
 
In 2017 the most common qualification for a KS4 student to sit was the BCS European Computing Driving Licence (ECDL). This course made up nearly four in ten of all computing examinations sat at this level. (students might sit multiple computing exams). ECDL was a valid qualification in the government's Progress 8 measurement for 2017 and it has been suggested that schools used this qualification disproportionately to help with their league table position [@ECDL_Edudata_2016]. As of 2018, ECDL can no longer be counted towards Progress 8 [@Busby2017ECDL], and we thus expect to see this course decrease significantly in uptake.
 
We previously predicted that there would be an overall decrease in the number of students sitting any computing course at KS4 and KS5. The 2017 report shows a small decrease in student numbers at KS4 since 2015. However, with ECDL being responsible for nearly four in ten entrants, it's decline, and the disappearance of GCSE ICT, means we may be facing a 'cliff edge' for students studying computing from 2018. This decline will be most acute amongst females, who make up almost half of ECDL (45.3%), 38% of GCSE ICT and only around 20% of GCSE computer science students. Only 34.2% of all females are taking a computing KS4 qualification, compared to 51.2% of all males. Since 2014, we have ~30,000 fewer females taking a computing qualification at KS4.

A range of replacement vocational computing qualifications suitable for Progress 8 have not been approved [@Havell2017Voca], meaning that many schools might choose to drop computing qualifications in favour of other courses that will help with their standing in league tables.
 
At KS5, overall numbers have increased to just over 100,000 students sitting any computing qualification, with female uptake increasing by nearly 6,000 on 2014 figures. There has been a huge drop in the number of students taking AS qualifications (a course that is often seen as a subset of the A-level). Again the demise of the ICT qualification looks likely to lead to a significant decrease in students taking any computing course at KS5, in particular this will impact females who make up ~30% of the cohort as opposed to ~9.5% of the computer science qualification.  Only 4.9% of females are taking any computing KS5 qualification, compared to 13.6% of males.

It was previously speculated that many independent schools were choosing to sit the IGCSE instead of the GCSE. Whilst there are more independent schools offering this subject than those in the state sector, the numbers remain low (66 independent schools and 813 students)
 
It is worth noting that females are generally better represented when taking digitally 'creative' KS4 courses, compared to computer science, as discussed in [@Wong2018Creative]. However, this pattern isn㤼㸲t as apparent at KS5.
