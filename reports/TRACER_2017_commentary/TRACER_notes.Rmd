- Where data is missing it has been excluded from calculations, for example a student might have ethnicity data stored against their student record, but not information about their free school meal status, as a result totals for the same subject might be slightly different
- Providers with fewer than 6 students are represented on the maps as having 5 students.
- There is currently a discrepancy in naming conventions for computing qualifications. Historically computer science qualifications have been called "computing", however, most new computer science qualifications are named "computer science" with a similar content set. We have tried to use "computing" to refer to the national curriculum subject that incorporates computer science, information technology and digital literacy[@furber2014shut], and "computer science" when we are talking about particular qualifications.
- Unless otherwise specified. 2017 data has been used, a report based on 2018 data will be published in late 2018/early 2019.
- 2017 saw the transition of several courses to the 1-9 grading system. For the sake of consistency, 1-9 grades have been converted to A\*-U grading.
- Comparisons are made throughout the document between computer science and ICT and physics. ICT was chosen because it is was previously the dominant 'computing' qualification that is now being withdrawn. Physics was chosen so that comparisons can be made between computer science and another science. In particular, physics was chosen over the other sciences as it is considered to be highly mathematical, and mathematics appears to be one of the main skill sets used to determine entry onto computing courses (see [Entry grade profile](#entry-grade-profile)). In addition, the BCS [-@BCSEBacc] used GCSE physics as the benchmark comparison when outlining the need for a computer science qualification. It was decided against using mathematics as the main comparison subject, because mathematics GCSE is taken by nearly all students and any comparison would not allow for differentiation from population data.
- There were `r Total_X_Schools_GCSE`providers and `r Total_X_Students_GCSE` students attached to schools with URN numbers of 900000 and above. These institutions are not on EduBase and it is unclear how these results are treated for statistical purposes by the DfE and other organisations. For the report above, these results have been redacted.
- Isle of Scilly data is not included in heat maps for GCSE
- Coastal schools are schools that are within 5.5 km of the coast.
- A-level student details have been completed from KS4 data where possible. For example a student might be missing pupil premium or ethnicity information in their A-level record, but it exists in their GCSE record; we then map the GCSE descriptors into the A-level record. Descriptive data at A-Level still remains relatively patchy  and categories such a historic pupil premium indicators can change, a a result caution should be taken when interpreting these statistics.
