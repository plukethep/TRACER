
GCSE CS students are more likely to take physics and chemistry, rather less likely to take history or single or double subject science.

Very few students (2.2% of all CS entrants) are taking computer science as a replacement for one of the other single sciences (i.e. 3 single science staken including CS). CS is taken in addition to the three other single sciences for 33.6% of CS students, and as an addition to core science for 38.2% of the CS cohort.
 
A-level CS students are likely to also take maths physics, further maths; less likely to take other popular subjects. For comparison, ICT students are more likely to take business studies, film/media and D&T product design.
